	<h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to complete as a function of the input size. An algorithm with lower time complexity is considered more efficient, especially when handling large inputs.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Space Complexity</b> measures the total amount of memory an algorithm needs to run to completion. It includes input storage, auxiliary space, and output storage. A common way to express this is using Big O notation, such as O(n), which indicates linear space usage.
